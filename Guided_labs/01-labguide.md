## **Setup-Instructions**

### **Setting-Up-a-Python-Environment-with-NumPy-Pandas-and-Scikit-learn**

**Step 1: Download the Python Installer:**

   ![Python Installation](https://www.python.org/static/img/python-logo.png)

   - Visit the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).
   - Locate a reliable version of Python 3, **"Download Python 3.11.9"**.
   - Choose the correct link for your device from the options provided: either Windows installer (64-bit) or Windows installer (32-bit) and proceed to download the executable file. 
   ![alt text](Images/python1.JPG)

---

**Step 2: Run the Installer:**
   1. Run the downloaded Python Installer.

   2. The installation window shows two checkboxes:

      - **Admin privileges:** The parameter controls whether to install Python for the current or all system users. This option allows you to change the installation folder for Python.

      - **Add Python to PATH:** The second option places the executable in the PATH variable after installation. You can also add Python to the PATH environment variable manually later.

      ![alt text](Images/python2.JPG)
      <br>

   3. Select the **Install Now** option for the recommended installation (in that case, skip the next two steps).

   <br>

   4. To adjust the default installation options, choose **Customize installation** instead and proceed to the following step.

   - **Installation Directory:** `C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python[version]`

   - **Included Components:**
     - **IDLE** (the default Python Integrated Development and Learning Environment).
     - **PIP** (Python's package installer).
     - **Additional Documentation.**
     
   - **The installer also creates:**
     - Required shortcuts.
     - File associations for `.py` files.

   If you choose the **"Customize Installation"** option during setup, you can modify the default configurations, such as the installation location, optional features, and advanced settings. This flexibility allows you to tailor the setup to your specific project requirements or environment.

---


**Step 3: Choose the optional installation features**
   - Python works without these features, but adding them improves the program's usability.

   ![alt text](Images/python3.JPG)

   - Click `Next` to proceed to the Advanced Options screen.

---
<br>

**Step 4: Choosing advanced options**
   - Choose whether to install Python for all users. The option changes the install location to C:\Program Files\Python[version]. 

   - If selecting the location manually, a common choice is C:\Python[version] because it avoids spaces in the path, and all users can access it.Due to administrative rights, both paths may cause issues during package installation.

   <br>

   After picking the appropriate options, click Install to start the installation.
   <br>

   ![alt text](Images/python5.JPG)

   <br>

   ![alt text](Images/python6.JPG)

   Select the option and close the setup.

---
<br>


**Step 5: Add Python to Path (Optional)**

If the Python installer does not include the Add Python to PATH checkbox or you have not selected that option, continue in this step. Otherwise, skip to the next step.

To add Python to PATH, do the following:

#### 1. In the **Start menu**, search for **Environment Variables** and press **Enter**.

![alt text](Images/image-2.png)


<br>

#### 2. Click **Environment Variables** to open the overview screen.

![alt text](Images/img8.JPG)


<br>

#### 3. Double-click **Path** on the list to edit it.

![alt text](Images/img9.png)

Alternatively, select the variable and click the Edit button.

<br>


#### 4. **Double-click the first empty field and paste the Python installation folder path for both system and user environmental variables for Administration**

![alt text](Images/im10.png)

Alternatively, click the **New button** instead and paste the path. Click **OK** to save the changes.
<br>


---

**Step 7: Verify Python Was Installed on Windows**

The first way to verify that Python was installed successfully is through the command line. Open the command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
python --version
```

<br>

![alt text](Images/i10.png)

The output shows the installed Python version.
<br>


**Verify PIP Was Installed**

To verify whether PIP was installed, enter the following command in the command prompt:

```bash
pip --version
```


If it was installed successfully, you should see the PIP version number, the executable path, and the Python version:


![alt text](Images/i11.png)
<br>

PIP has not been installed yet if you get the following output:

```
'pip' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
Operable program or batch file.
```

---


**Step 8: Connect VScode with Python**
To set up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with Python, follow these steps:

**1. Install Visual Studio Code:**
   - Download and install the latest version of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) for your operating system.

   - Click **Install** to add the extension to your VS Code.
   <br>


   - To select and set the Python interpreter in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), follow these steps:
      - **Open the Command Palette**: You can open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.

      - **Select Interpreter**: Type `Python: Select Interpreter` in the Command Palette and press Enter.

      ![alt text](Images/python9.png)

      - **Choose an Interpreter**: VS Code will display a list of available Python interpreters. Select the one you want to use. If you have a virtual environment or a specific Python installation, ensure itâ€™s activated or listed here.

      ![alt text](Images/python10.png)

      - **Verify the Interpreter**: You can verify the selected interpreter by checking the bottom-left corner of VS Code. It should display the selected Python version and the path to the interpreter.

      - **Set Interpreter Path Manually**: If the desired interpreter is not listed, you can manually set the interpreter path in the `settings.json` file by adding or modifying the following line:

      ```json
      "python.pythonPath": "path/to/your/python"
      ```

      Replace `"path/to/your/python"` with the actual path to the Python interpreter.



**3. Create a Python File:**
   - Open a new file in your workspace.

   - Save it with the `.py` extension (e.g., `main.py`).
   <br>


**4. Write and Run Python Code:**
   - Type a simple Python script, such as:

     ```python
     print("Hello, World!")
     ```

   - Save the file.

   
**Run the Python file**
- Use the command below in your terminal to run the Python file:
 
```bash
python main.py
```

   ![alt text](Images/i16.png)

   This is the terminal output (Hello World)
   <br>



**Step 9: Install Libraries**

To install the essential libraries, open your command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
<br>

This command will install NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn, which are essential for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning tasks.

**Step 9: Verify Library Installation**

To verify the installation, you can run a simple script that imports the libraries and prints their versions. Follow these steps to create and run the script in Visual Studio Code (VS Code):



**1. Open VS Code**
   - Launch Visual Studio Code from your Start menu or desktop shortcut.
   <br>

**2. Create a New Python File**
   - Click on `File > New File` or press `Ctrl+N` to create a new file.

   - Save the file with a `.py` extension, e.g., `verify_libraries.py`, by clicking on `File > Save As` or pressing `Ctrl+S`.

   <br>

**3. Write the Verification Script**
   - In the new file, type the following Python script:

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   import pandas as pd
   import sklearn

   print("NumPy version:", np.__version__)
   print("Pandas version:", pd.__version__)
   print("Scikit-learn version:", sklearn.__version__)
   ```


**Run the Python file**
- Use the command below in your terminal to run the Python file:
